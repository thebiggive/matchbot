/**
 * In rare cases, only after a process or infrastructure crash, it might be necessary to update
 * CampaignFundings' available amounts - and critically the authoritative amounts in Redis (or whatever
 * the live matching adapter is) - based on the total of donations' `FundingWithdrawal`s.
 *
 * This effectively reverses the normal source of authority for matching totals, treating the less-
 * realtime values as *more* accurate than the realtime ones, and should therefore only be run in
 * exceptional circumstances, where:
 *
 *  1. you have reason to believe the authoritative totals are wrong
 *  2. you understand why that has happened and are sure it won't happen again
 *  3. you expect donations to be at a low volume when you run this, reducing the risk of things
 *     getting back out of sync because of donations coming in while it runs
 *
 * Keep in mind that it is also normal while reservations are happening for funds to *briefly* diverge and show up
 * in the output of this command (this underscores the reason it's important to use the 'fix' mode sparingly!) Before
 * taking action based on a reported mismatch, run the command a second time and check the same funds and amounts
 * are listed as the first time.
