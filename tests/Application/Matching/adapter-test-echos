remaining in fund: -160_00   ## -160_00 is equal to the 50_00 that the fund started with, as it was a fund with Â£50,
minus 7 * 30_00 because the callback (representing another process) took out 30_00 seven times, and as that is another
process its not our responsibility to replace it. Except logs above show callback only taking 30_00 six times, plus the
first call to subtractAmountWithoutSavingToDB in our thread did not fail, so took out 30_00 that does not get returned.

If the other thread returned its 30*6 then the fund would be at 20, which is correct since we started at 50 and had
a successful withdrawal of 30.
